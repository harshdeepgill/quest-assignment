# Quest Labs Mobile UI Assignment

## Overview

This repository contains the code for a mobile screen UI designed using React for an assignment given by Quest Labs. The UI is built with a focus on accuracy and aesthetics, incorporating beautiful animations to enhance the user experience.

## Technologies Used

### 1. React

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Its component-based architecture makes it easy to manage and organize UI elements, promoting reusability and maintainability.

### 2. Redux

Redux is a state management library that helps manage the state of the application in a predictable way. It is particularly useful for large and complex applications, providing a single source of truth for the entire application state.

### 3. React-Redux

React-Redux is the official binding for React and Redux, enabling seamless integration of Redux with React components. It simplifies the process of connecting components to the Redux store and accessing the application state.

### 4. Axios

Axios is a promise-based HTTP client for making asynchronous requests in JavaScript. It simplifies data fetching and handling HTTP responses, making it a reliable choice for API interactions in React applications.

### 5. Styled-Components

Styled-Components is a CSS-in-JS library that allows you to write CSS directly in your JavaScript files. It offers a more maintainable and scoped styling approach for React components, enhancing modularity and reusability.

## Benefits of Using These Technologies

- **React**: Provides a modular and efficient way to build user interfaces, improving code organization and maintainability.

- **Redux**: Ensures a centralized and predictable state management system, making it easier to debug and maintain large-scale applications.

- **React-Redux**: Simplifies the integration of React with Redux, enhancing the overall development experience.

- **Axios**: Offers a simple and powerful way to handle HTTP requests, with features like interceptors and automatic JSON parsing.

- **Styled-Components**: Enhances component styling by encapsulating styles within the components, reducing the risk of style conflicts and improving maintainability.

## Deployment
